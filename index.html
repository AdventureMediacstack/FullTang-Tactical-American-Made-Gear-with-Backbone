                <h3 data-start="219" data-end="247">Founding and Inspiration</h3>
                <p data-start="249" data-end="813"><a href="https://fulltangtactical.com/pages/about" target="_blank" title="FullTang Tactical About Page" rel="noopener">FullTang Tactical (FTT)</a> is a small, family-owned outdoor gear company rooted in the backwoods of Tennessee. The name comes from the founder’s boyhood obsession with “full-tang” knives and hatchets, where the steel runs through the handle for unmatched strength. Growing up roaming the mountains of North Carolina, the pine forests of Maine, and the backwoods of Tennessee, the founder - known simply as “JT” - developed a deep respect for rugged tools and self-reliance. That mindset became the foundation of the company: build gear where quality runs to the core.</p>
                <p data-start="815" data-end="1249">After a successful career as a business executive, JT launched FullTang Tactical to fill a void he’d personally experienced: gear that could meet his standards didn’t seem to exist. His mission was simple: create hybrid equipment that bridges bushcraft and tactical use, capable of thriving in both rugged wilderness and operational environments. His business background gave him the tools; his backcountry roots gave him the vision.</p>

                <h3 data-start="1251" data-end="1273">JT and His Mission</h3>
                <p data-start="1275" data-end="1666">JT is more than a brand owner. He’s the designer, the builder, the customer service rep, and often the one stitching gear late into the night. He doesn’t promote himself as a personality, but he’s the driving force behind FTT’s culture. His passion for gear shows in every customer email he answers, every prototype tested in the field, and every product made to order in his Tennessee shop.</p>
                <p data-start="1668" data-end="2034">Only top-tier, U.S.-sourced MIL-SPEC materials make the cut. That’s not a slogan...when two of the top domestic textile mills shut down in 2025, JT was upfront with customers and immediately sourced replacements without compromising his American-made standard. His philosophy is straightforward: build it right, back it with a warranty, and stand behind every order.</p>
                <h3 data-start="2036" data-end="2074">American Craftsmanship and Quality</h3>
                <p data-start="2076" data-end="2549">The gear reflects that ethos. <a href="https://stayreadyoutdoors.com/products/modular-chest-rig-kit-bag?_pos=2&amp;_sid=dfaedd132&amp;_ss=r" target="_blank" title="Modular Chest Rig Kit" rel="noopener">The Modular Chest Rig–Kit Bag</a>, for example, is a fully modular system built from 500D Cordura, Squadron™ laminate, and waterproof YKK AquaGuard® zippers. It works as a standalone pack, integrates with larger systems, or converts into a plate carrier placard. A rear kangaroo pouch and triple-magazine insert can turn a hiking loadout into a combat rig in seconds. Everything is loop-lined and ready for internal organizers, IFAKs, or holsters.</p>
                <p data-start="2551" data-end="2944">This isn’t boardroom design. JT field-tests everything in the Tennessee hills, dragging rigs through thick brush and tweaking strap angles until the load rides right. His <a href="https://stayreadyoutdoors.com/products/b-a-r-frame-set?_pos=2&amp;_sid=7358fbee7&amp;_ss=r" target="_blank" title="Minuteman B.A.R - Build a Ruck Frame for Alice Packs" rel="noopener">Minuteman</a> ruck pairs rigid frame support for heavy gear with padded hip belts for comfort over miles of travel. Harness systems use reinforced laminate and padded sleeves for cable routing and balanced weight distribution.</p>
                <p data-start="2946" data-end="3273">The modularity is extreme but never gimmicky. Start with a <a href="https://stayreadyoutdoors.com/products/low-vis-modular-kit-bag?_pos=12&amp;_sid=dfaedd132&amp;_ss=r" target="_blank" title="Low-Vis Chest Rig from FullTang Tactical for EDC and Concealment" rel="noopener">basic chest rig</a> and scale it into a load-bearing system that replaces a backpack or serves as your primary loadout. These aren’t just ideas, FTT gear has been used by servicemembers during Tactical Urban Sustainment Courses (TUSC) and proven in real-world conditions.</p>
                <h3 data-start="3275" data-end="3313">Reputation and Community Reception</h3>
                <p data-start="3315" data-end="3532">Within the preparedness and bushcraft community, FTT gear is known for exceeding expectations. Reviews regularly praise both the build quality and customer service, with lead times met even during heavy order periods.</p>
                <p data-start="3534" data-end="3859">Early on, some assumed FTT might be another white-labeled import. The reality is the opposite. Counterfeiters have even copied JT’s designs on overseas marketplaces, a backhanded compliment to the originality and demand for the real thing. Customers know they’re getting gear handmade in Tennessee, not mass-produced abroad.</p>
                <p data-start="3861" data-end="4006">The brand has also caught the attention of tactical medics, defense contractors, and other professionals drawn to its modular, adaptable designs.</p>

                <h3 data-start="4008" data-end="4030">Dealer Testimonial</h3>
                <p data-start="4032" data-end="4155">From my own experience as a dealer, I quickly saw JT’s integrity, honesty, and relentless work ethic. The man doesn’t stop.</p>
                <p data-start="4157" data-end="4387">Every call about project ideas and kit builds makes it clear he’s juggling a hundred irons in the fire....and he’s genuinely excited about all of them. His confidence in his gear comes from firsthand knowledge and total investment.</p>
                <p data-start="4389" data-end="4674">After our first conversation, I knew I wanted to work with FullTang Tactical. Since then, we’ve been collaborating on new survival kit offerings that pair my system-based builds with his no-compromise designs. Expect to see serious field-ready solutions with FullTang gear at the core.</p>
                <h3 data-start="4676" data-end="4711">Community Engagement and Growth</h3>
                <p data-start="4713" data-end="5041">JT lives in the world his gear is built for. He attends events like the Georgia Bushcraft Fall Gathering to meet customers, explain product features, and gather real-world feedback. His social media presence is straightforward and transparent, whether he’s talking about textile shortages or showing off new camouflage patterns.</p>
                <p data-start="5043" data-end="5352">Behind-the-scenes content shows him running industrial machines, prototyping rigs, and refining designs in real time. The FullTang YouTube channel offers deep dives into configurations and development stories: real shop-floor insight, not marketing filler. That authenticity is what resonates with customers.</p>
                <p data-start="5354" data-end="5612">Word-of-mouth growth comes not from influencer hype but from trust in the gear and the man who builds it. In a market full of drop-shipped imports, FullTang Tactical is exactly what it says it is: hard-use American equipment, built for real-world conditions.</p>
                <h3 data-start="5614" data-end="5631">Looking Ahead</h3>
                <p data-start="5633" data-end="5880">FullTang Tactical continues to grow without losing its identity. Lead times may run a few weeks, but every piece is built with care, not pulled from a shelf. JT’s focus on quality, service, and innovation is rare, and it’s why his gear stands out.</p>
                <p data-start="5882" data-end="6141">In a world full of shortcuts, FullTang Tactical proves there are still makers who do it the right way: with hands, heart, and heritage. Every stitch is deliberate. Every order matters. And every customer becomes part of the tribe that stands behind the name.</p>
